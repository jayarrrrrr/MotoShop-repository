# TODO: Implement Cart Functionality

## Completed Steps
- [x] Analyze existing cart-related files (models, views, templates, URLs)
- [x] Identify that cart_view only handles GET, but needs to handle POST for adding items
- [x] Modify cart_view in orders/views.py to handle POST requests for adding products to cart
- [x] Import necessary models (CartItem, Product) in views.py

## Pending Steps
- [ ] Test the cart functionality by running the server and adding items to cart
- [ ] Verify that items are added correctly and cart displays properly
